      - Go back to the 12 Factor App 
      - What are "Apps" made of?
        - Services
        - Usually some kind of "driver"
          - Could be a Gateway API 
            - A gateway could be segmented
            - "Strangler Fig"
            - *Maybe* show some API Tests 
              - Talk about "Refactoring to Microservices"
          - Could be a UI, or a variety of UI.
